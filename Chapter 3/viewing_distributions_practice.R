library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")
library("dplyr")

## 1) Create a histogram of population using the 2007 data



## 2) Explore the population distributions for the continents Europe and Africa
## in 2007 using density plots.



## 3) Create a series of box plots of life expectancy by year for the entire
## gapminder dataset. Hint: you'll need to use the "group" aesthetic to group
## the data by year.
