## 1) Choose two countries and plot their GDP over time with lines colored by country.




## 2) Using only the data for Europe, create a scatter plot of 2007 population
## vs. life expectancy with points sized by GDP.




## 3) Create a density plot of life expectancy by continent (excluding Oceania)
## using the gapminder data from 2007. Color the density plot by continent, and
## experiment with both the `color` and `fill` aesthetics.
