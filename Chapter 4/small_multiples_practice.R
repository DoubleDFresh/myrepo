## Practice exercises: small multiples

library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")
library("dplyr")

## 1) Using the full gapminder dataset create histograms, each with twenty bins,
## of life expectancy facetted by continent and year.




## 2) Create a series of scatter plots of GDP vs life expectancy with points
## colored by continent. Facet these plots by year.




## 3) Using only the data from Asia, create a series of line charts of life
## expectancy over time, facetted by country.
