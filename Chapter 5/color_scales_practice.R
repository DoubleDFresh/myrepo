## Practice exercises: color scales

library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")
library("dplyr")

## 1) Create a line chart of median population over time by continent. Color the
## lines by continent using the Color Brewer palette called "Set2" and set the
## line size to 1.5.




## 2) For certain geoms like bars, there are two color-related aesthetics that
## data can be mapped to: `color` and `fill`. Create a bar chart of median
## population by continent for the year 1952 and experiment with mapping
## continent to the `color` and `fill` aesthetics with the "Set2" Color Brewer
## palette.
